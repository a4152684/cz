I had use one many times in Hotels, when I found out I could order one,I ordered two.<br />I love mine,lot of power , blows hair dry great, I am glad I buy two.
Great price for a great product. has a small light that turns on while your bathroom light is off, i would highly recommend it.
Love this blow dryer! Does exactly what it says...dries fast with less frizz! Lighter weight and quiet motor, too. Would definitely recommend!!
it works fine, i am buying a new one. I thought this would be fine for work but as it turns out, its rather loud, has no heat settings, and the concentrator falls off.....
This is a powerful, quick, perfect hair dryer. Definitely recommend it for salon professionals. The price is unreal ... It's better than the 150 dollar models I've had in the past.
I would prefer a separate low, medium, high switch for temperature from the low,medium, high for the fan.  This has a single low, medium, high for temp+fan, with a push button to allow for no heat, just blown air.  The retractable cord, and folding handle, though, are the real pluses that save the day.
As its a lot stronger than Conair's hair dryer and can get your hair dry in 15 mins (I have waist length thick wavy hair). Not very heavy (I am a small person and it doesn't feel heavy in my hand). Like all other hair dryers it does dry out your hair and damage it. If you use it on the highest setting and for longer duration like 25 mins, you will not need to straighten your hair too much as this itself would do the job. However, unlike the straightener, this will keep the volume of your hair.
It works pretty good is easy to hold and not heavy like some of those out there.I really like this.
Other than that it's fine. I have one other minor objection. I mounted mine in the leg well under the dressing area on the left side. There one can see the led light leaking out the bottom of the cabinet and not just through the bezel that it is supposed to. the light leak is something I could fix with RTV silicon, I just haven't bothered. A better design would include a case that fits better to it's base and doesn't leak light, and would also only have the light on when it's dark instead of all the time. Again, it's not quiet. We bought it for our guest bath, so as much as our guests stay here they shouldn't go deaf. No way I'd put up with this noise if it was our primary. This unit doesn't deserve to call itself quiet, so if you need quiet keep shopping.
It only has two intensity levels, either too low or too high and loud. The hairdryer blew off the electricity in my apartment TWICE!
Great product.  My Daughter uses it everyday, this was a christmas gift and it's getting used, holding up just fine.  Shipment was fast and packaging was great.
I have used the same Hello Kitty hair dryer almost every day for 5 years. It is light weight but not when it comes to heat and air. I have thick long hair and it dries quickly and smoothly. I like it so much I have purchased several for gran-daughters, girl friends and once as a bridal shower gift. Everyone has elaborated on how much they like this product and a few have carried on the gift choice to their family and friends. I had purchased them at Target but now, thanks to my Amazon Prime Shipping, I don't have to purchase, then spend money to ship
I bought it because it's not very expensive and free shipping. It's very good quality and not so so big . Only thing is you can't fold it.
I hope that Amazon fixed their search suggestions after I had to return this one with the related comments.<br />My wife loved it and has a similar but older model drier that still works ( for 5 years, I think).<br /><br />Anyway, I was looking for 220 Volt drier and had to return this one in the end
I gave it for stars because it is noisy. I didn't use it very much on my last trip, but it came in handy for drying clothes in a humid climate. It's also handy if someone is in the bathroom and you can't use the hotel hair dryer. For the price, it's worth keeping one in my suitcase.
The dryer works very well.  Dries hair quickly. Like the choice of settings  It is rather large so not suitable for travel
Well the subject sais it all.  I scored big on this.  I bought it because of the reviews and I hit the jackpot.  My wife spent at least 15 minutes drying her hair each day.  My daughter has reached the age of needing to dry her hair each day so sharing the $20 target special had become a real hassle.<br /><br />The first morning my wife used it she was simply amazed how well it did.  She thought it might be a little hot for my daughter (age 11) but she was not sure.  We just gave her the cheap hair dryer and my wife is using this one.  I assume this will hold up well over time.  If we have any mechanical problems or anything negative develops then I will edit this review and add the updated information.  I give it 2 thumbs up!
I was surprised to find that the  item was not as quiet as claimed.  That was the feature I was looking for.
I have been using it for almost 3 years! I don't have anything negative to say about it! Love that it has different speed and heat settings. If anyone complains it is too big or heavy, well, I've got to say this is not a portable hair dryer.
Its just what I wanted.and I am happy with it.  There is nothing more that I can say about this dryer with the exception that it is working very well.
Not too loud, toggle switch is a nice feature, and most importantly... you can hold onto the &#34;head&#34; of the dryer without worrying about it getting too hot. I never like to hold the dryer from the designated handle region, so this was a really nice feature. Good price too. I used to use the babybliss dryers, but found they were too powerful for my hair, so I opted for this product, and I love it!
Exactly what I was looking for. Love the retractable cord and the folding handle! Sturdy unit with good power. Would definately recommend!
This has to be the best hair dryer I have ever used. My hair is thick and tends to get frizzy after I blow dry it. But with this dryer my hair is shinny and healthy looking rather then looking like I stuck my finger in a electric socket. It dries it quickly and gives it a more styled looked. Love this hair dryer and Would recommend it to anyone.
I wash and dry my hair everyday.  I used this hair dryer in a hotel and loved it!  I've been searching for a good hair dryer that didn't break the bank for years.  My husband also commented that it drys my hair quicker. It leaves my hair so soft.  My hairdresser even said I must be doing something right.  The retractable cord is great.  And, I love the folding handle for travel.
I have curly hair and this hair dryer has a cold setting which helps to keep my curls from being frizzy.  My last hair dryer did not have a cold setting but just a freeze type button.  I actually wore out the button so I needed to purchase a new hair dryer.  I like that this dryer does not have a flimsy, lightweight feel. I also love that it is black with pink accents.  I am very glad I purchased this product.
Do not underestimate the size of this dryer. My goodness this dryer is hottttt. I have weave in my hair and I decided to wash it and lord this dryer dried the hair within 10-15minutes. I really really really like it and for the price, you can't beat that. What more could you ask for.
Great product. It dries my hair super fast. A friend of mine has had hers for years and I am hoping to as well!
I've had it for over 2 months and love it so far!  I have no problems with the nozzle falling off, it blows my hair dry in 1/2 the time it took before, and my hair feels so much softer!  I love it!
We use this in our guest rooms at Four Seasons - I recently bought it for the gym since it's a full size but you are able to fold the handle.  It's really quiet AND powerful - great value too.  The retractable cord is also great esp. for travel.
i have never had a ionic hairdryer...i have no more frizz after i blow my hair out. i have for years used conditioner thinking this would help with the frizzing but i had no conditioner and my hair was just like at the salon with no frizz.
I have had this hair dryer for about 6 months now and it works great. The night light is still on and works fine.
****UPDATE 2nd order****<br />As below, I ordered a second replacement.  We got less than a year out of this one before the sparks started flying again.  Yes, we kept it clear of lint etc. [it has an easy to remove cap to do this] and the thing does not get daily use.  How one can last 3 years and the next only a year is beyond me.  I gave them a second chance....but no more.  One spark in the eye could ruin your vision for life.  Dangerous product to say the least.<br /><br />Purchased this in 2009 and since the sparks started flying out of the dryer this week I decided to leave a review.  It's worked flawless until today.  My wife was drying her hair and sparks started coming out the end.  This has happened before with other dryers thus the reason for my 4 star review.  I'm buying another one as it will match the holes on the wall that are already there and it's been a nice small hair dryer....and for the price, can't beat it lasting 3 years. Not too concerned about the sparks as the heating wires over time get thin from all the heat...it's almost something you expect to happen and no one was hurt in the process.  Overall a nice compact good looking unit.
This hair dryer is exactly what we've been looking for and this is the only place we were able to find it.  It was easy to order, and the shipping time was short.  I will probably order again from amazon.com.
It is a good thing that my limited edition Revlon blow dryer broke after only 6 months. Because I replaced it with the John Frieda full volume blow dryer this morning and I was simply stunned at the difference in quality. I have had many brands of blow dryers over the years and it has always taken me at least 10 minutes to completely blow dry my very thick hair. However this John Frieda blow dryer took my very thick, shoulder length hair from soaking wet to bone dry and ready for hot rollers in three minutes! Yes, you read that right... three minutes! This blow dryer is going to save me so much time when I am in a hurry and trying to get out the door. It is worth every single penny and then some. I love, love, love this blow dryer and highly recommend it!
I hardly ever write reviews of products -- I can't even remember the last one I wrote. However, I'm pretty inspired right now. This dryer has cut my styling time to less than half of what it's always been. It's not frizzy, so I'm not doing tons of follow-up flat-ironing. And, the most important part is that my ridiculously thick hair is completely dry when I'm finished.<br /><br />Now, it remains to be seen how long this hairdryer will hold up, but for now, I'm pretty sure this is the best purchase I've made in years.
This is exactly like one I used in a luxury hotel.  I was so impressed with it that I had to have one of my own.
Purchased this for during my recovery from shoulder surgery.  We used the anchors and screws to permanently attach this to the wall.  Now after recovery, I still use this when I want a great looking salon style blow-out of my long hair.  I wish I had purchased this years ago, as it makes styling my below shoulder length hair super easy.
Bought it for her for the birthday.  It is worth spending the extra couple of bucks over the other ones.  Makes a racket but they all do.  The thing I read about it being hard to get to the buttons is kind of ridiculous.  They are not difficult to push/ avoid pushing unless you have the most sausage of sausage fingers.  Apparently does not dry out her hair; or the dogs hair for that matter.
Plus - I've had this microwave installed for about 4 months now and I really like it.  It cooks evenly and in a predictable way...much better than the traditional turntable models.  The coolness factor is high and its easy for the kids to use.  I love how it fits in with my new kitchen.<br />Minus -  it's pricey for a microwave.  Considering, the price I expected it to have a few more quick features, like a 30 second reheat button (it will do 1 min).  The open/close mechanism is noisy and closes with a &#34;clunk&#34; .  The special cooking features are complicated to program so I have yet to use them.<br />Summary - It was worth the splurge.
I have very limited space so the design to fit in corner is great. I only use for re-heating or defrosting so it is fine for that. Some of my dinner plates are too large to fit in it...so I use smaller plates for re-heating. I don't like the lack of number pad but I knew it didn't have one when I bought it. It DOES have it's own popcorn button...:)
The Motor fit perfect, works great, price was excellent.<br />Was much cheaper than new microwave A A A A plus
All purchase and shipping activities were fine. Microwave door on this model not well designed. It sticks and won't open or close properly if the unit is not perfectly level meaning installation under cabinet must be virtually perfect. Appliance repair person told me this is always a problem with this model. Wish I knew that before purchasing.
Googled by the model number and brought me here to see what a piece of crap that Whirlpool have made.<br />This is suppose be the upgraded version that my builder put in, yet with hardly any usage, this thing crap out on me.<br />I am the 35th customer that's pissed off of owning this crap.<br /><br />It is amazing that Whirpool have the balls to sell this microwave at all.<br /><br />Never ever going to get anything from Whirpool ever again.
Had 6 months.  It works fine as a microwave, but the control pad is a little small and you have to be careful where to push to get the button you want. Window is hard to see the food through, and it always fogs up making it even harder. I like the favorites program, but they should build in an automatic delay between stages. This is because if you program 1 min at high, and 1 min at 50%, you actually get about 1:15 straight high. A third stage would also be nice.  I don't like the push button door latch.  It takes a lot of effort, and if it gets dirty, is hard to clean because it pushes in 1/4 inch without any effort, making wiping it hard. It should have s simple handle.
I expected this microwave oven to be smaller than it is. I was hoping for a small microwave to go in the craft room for my wife because she spends a lot of time in there and her coffee often goes cold, and instead of having to get up and leave her work, she can reach over and reheat her coffee. I didn't want something that takes up a lot of space. Well, this is about as small as I've seen, but I thought there were smaller ones. We don't have a lot of extra space so we bought this one. It works fine, I personally don't like the bright blue LED clock on the front but my wife doesn't mind. It does what it's supposed to.
Just like everyone else, I own this microwave. it died after 1yr of normal use right after the warranty ran out. When it worked there were no issues.
Has been owned for less than a year.. started sparking and had to stop using.  Now shopping for a new one.
This microwave came with my new home and overall, I am very pleased with it. It is sturdily-built and has an attractive stainless steel finish and design. It does a great job at heating up and cooking food, and even though it may not have all of the features of a more expensive microwave, the features it does have, work well. I particularly like the turntable and the add 30 seconds button. The only downside I can think of is that it does not have the express 1 minute, 2 minute, etc. buttons. When it comes to a microwave, simplicity in use is key and this one definitely fits the bill.
Man I wish I'd read these reviews before buying this. I was at a local Big Box store and saw this on the shelf, decided to buy it on impulse.  After all, it's a GE and that's a great brand, right?<br />It was disappointing from the start. I don't use a microwave for much other that popcorn and heating freezer meals, and it couldn't even handle those. The popcorn setting burned the popcorn (my old, cheapo Sharp would always stop at just the right time.)  The meals were heated unevenly.<br />And now, after less than a month of very light use, the display flickers and it refuses to turn on.<br />After reading these reviews I decided it wasn't even worth repairing. I've junked it and bought a highly rated Panasonic from Amazon (along with a 3-year Square Trade warranty).<br />What a piece of junk!
This little microwave fits into the corner.  We have limited counter space and switching to this mircrowave give us back so much room without losing the convenience.  If you cook in your microwave it won't hold a 9x12 baker, so keep that in mind when deciding.
Although I did not buy this microwave on line, I feel the need to warn potential buyers.  Caveat Emptor.<br />Unless you really like loud appliances, do not buy this one.  It sounds like a jet about to take off. I expected it to sound like a normal microwave. Not, a 747. One may think I am making a mountain out of a molehill, but I am hard of hearing and it is still loud to me.  I can only imagine what it sounds like to one with normal hearing.  'Nuff said.
Started making a buzzing / arcing sound this morning.  Opened door, smelled burning electronics, unplugged for 30 minutes, tried again with nothing inside, same result.  Dead, going to recycling.  Getting a Panasonic Commercial Grade microwave instead - all residential microwaves seem to have reliability issues.
We bought all new Samsung appliance for our new home. The microwave and refrigerator have had to be repaired. The microwave started leaking microwaves and burned the inside lip of the unit and on the inside of the door, burning the paint. Samsung replaced the unit after it was seen by an appliance repairman and photos were uploaded to them. My replacement unit just died for no reason. I checked the outlet, breaker and plug - all fine. I have to wait another week before the appliance repairman can come out and tell me I'll have to wait another 2 weeks for a new unit to arrive. Then, I'll have to pay for it to be installed again.
Perfect fit for a tiny counter space. Looks great and does small reheats well. Interior space is not huge but fits a dinner plate snugly
We purchased this microwave in Oct 2011 and it stopped heating in June 2013.  The defective part is the magnetron.  The magnetron has a 5 year warranty but it will cost $90 and 3 days for GE to come to my home to confirm that is the problem.  Then I am told I can expect to pay another $250-$300 for the labor for them to come back out and replace the magnetron, no idea how long that will take.  Fighting with GE at the moment to have the part shipped to my local repair man who said he would replace for $99 total.  Warranty information does not say anything about it having to be replace by a GE tech.<br /><br />We bought all new GE appliances in October 2011 and so far we have had to have the fridge and now the microwave repaired in the first 2 years.  I guess we still have the range and dishwasher to look forward to fixing.<br />I thought GE was a good company but experience has cleared things up.
Purchased this about a month ago and am now on #3 which will be returned too.  The panel around the button to open the micro continues to come off.  Also, it takes at least two pushes to get the door open - with fairly forceful attempts.  It's really a shame because it works well otherwise and fits perfectly in our new kitchen.
Fits beautifully in a corner of my kitchen so much better than a full sized rectangular one ever did.  Because the controls are on the bottom (instead of the side) the door is higher and it easily clears the edge of the sink next to it and, occasionally, drying dishes without having to move anything.<br /><br />Love the sleekness of the look and simplicity of the controls.  Miss the number pad a bit, but knew it didn't have one when I bought it and am quickly adjusting.  Power control and basic instructions on what setting to use have been helpful (couldn't even figure out power setting on previously owned machine!).  Oh and the very short beeps at the end of a cycle are not nearly as annoying as the longer ones on other models I have owned.<br /><br />We typically use for reheating food (single or multiple servings) or beverages and the occasional bowl of popcorn and it heats quite well.  In fact, the popcorn button is the only part I completely dislike, as it is preset for only 1.75 oz bags and cannot be changed.  We gave up preservative laden pre-packaged bags of popcorn years ago in favor of real kernels using a special bowl or paper bag, so the popcorn setting is useless for us.  Have not noticed any difference in heating between this and previous full size model we owned, except that beverages seem to heat faster.  Full sized plates fit and have had no issue with container heights (even my large popcorn bowl fits nicely).<br /><br />Bought the white version online at Home Depot, as their price was actually better than Amazon's and included free delivery as well.  Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a smaller microwave.
We purchased this model in white last month and just installed it a week ago. Easy to install and looks very nice. The downside with this is there's no operating instructions except for a few basic ones printed on the face of the unit when you open the door, and they are not adequate. I still haven't figured out how to simply thaw a 1/4 cup of frozen blueberries for my cereal in the morning - very frustrating. It DID do a very even job of reheating a casserole, but the lack of a booklet to reference is very disappointing. Once I am able to figure out how it use it more efficiently, I'm sure I will be happier with it.
Microwave didn't work when I received it.  It was really disappointing.  It was a great looking microwave but very sad to have to return it.
I bought this because the counter footprint and wattage were both low. I didn't expect very intuitive controls, a super easy-to-clean interior, weirdly efficient heating (stuff gets hot FAST) and thoughtful design touches like an interior light that switches off with disuse, and a polite, non-obnoxious &#34;your stuff is done&#34; beep that only goes off a few times before quieting down. It's a great little microwave. Bit tall, but that should be obvious from the pictures.  Update: Died in 2017 after years of faithful service, and I'm going to replace it with the same model. It has a totally unmatched capacity to footprint ratio, and I'm really annoyed that no one else is making microwaves that stack the mechanical bits under or over the food cavity. This is obviously the better way to build a microwave.
While searching for others with the same problem we're having I found these reviews: our Advantium died in about 2 1/2 years. We work from home and, one day, smelled smoke that we traced to our Advantium which was turned off and that had been turned off for some time. It was hot to the touch. We unplugged the Advantium and the the smoke smell went away: it had spontaneously turned on and was melting itself down. Plugging it back in turns it on without pressing any buttons. GE says this is not a fire hazard because there are supposed to be safety's to prevent it from burning down the house. I'm not so sure -- their credibility is shot -- but even if there are those safety's are built with the same low quality as the Advantium so cannot be reasonably relied upon. GE says the problem is with the keypad but that there aren't any more keypads to buy, probably because they all fail. The Advantium is a piece of junk. Save yourself money and protect your family from this potential fire hazard: avoid GE appliances.    [Update: after several calls and an eternity on hold GE acknowledged the problem and send a tech with a new Advantium that seems to be working well. I wouldn't buy another -- there are clearly QA issues with the Advantium -- but after lots of time on the phone GE did make this right. I'd still prefer a different manufacturer though and wish I'd bought a different cooker. If you're in the market for a microwave/cooker buy a different one.]
DESCRIPTION<br />&#62; Can be mounted in a 24&#34; wide X 12&#34; deep space.  Not intended to be installed above a range (standard ranges are 30&#34; wide), does not include a built-in hood for use above a range.<br />&#62; Has the great simple operation of previous Spacemakers: for example to heat a cup of coffee 1 minute, place it in the microwave and press &#34;1&#34;.  That's all.<br />&#62; Well built, albeit with more plastic and less metal than my old Spacemaker II.<br />&#62; Quieter than my old Spacemaker II--although that's no big deal.<br />&#62; The turntable is a nice addition (my old Spacemaker II did not have a turntable), but reduces the total space available (unless you turn the turntable off).<br />&#62; Has all of the controls and options of my old Spacemaker II:<br />...Plus popcorn, &#34;beverage&#34;, &#34;reheat&#34;, &#34;chicken/fish&#34;, &#34;potato&#34;, and &#34;vegetable&#34; buttons (which I probably won't use because I like to know what the microwave is doing).<br />...Other new buttons are &#34;delay start&#34;, &#34;reminder&#34;, &#34;turntable on/off&#34;, and &#34;add 30 sec&#34;.  The &#34;add 30 sec&#34; works on its own, you can press it and get just 30 seconds OR add 30 seconds to any time.  30 seconds is ideal for warming a cup of coffee, or heating some pastries.<br />...There is a child lockout, but without a dedicated button.<br /><br />UNDERCOUNTER INSTALLATION<br />&#62; The microwave itself comes with a paper template for drilling the necessary holes, but the template can be confusing and may not apply in all cases.<br />&#62; The microwave hangs from four ~1 1/4&#34;-long machine screws, which are inserted from above, from inside the cabinet above.  If the floor of the cabinet is greater than 1/2&#34; thick, then the length of the screws needs to be equal to the thickness of the floor plus 1/2&#34;.<br />&#62; Hypothetically, you could install the microwave with the four screws from your local hardware store, and 4 big washers (e.g., 2&#34; in diameter).  However the installation kit is probably easier.<br />&#62; If you use the template, double check the logic, and adjust the location of the screw holes accordingly.<br />... The key measurement is the distance from the front holes to the front of the cabinet. You usually want the front of the microwave to be flush with the front of the closed doors of the cabinet.  (That is, the front holes should be approximately 3 1/4&#34; back from the front of the closed doors).<br />... The door of the microwave needs an extra 1/8&#34; on the left in order to open fully, and the grill for the ventilation fan is on the left side of the microwave.  If there is an obstruction on the left side (such as wall, cabinet, or refrigerator), you may wish to shift the holes 1/4&#34; to the right, if you can.<br /><br />UNDERCOUNTER INSTALLATION KIT<br />&#62; If this is an new undercounter installation, or the space between the front and back screw holes (inside the cabinet above the microwave) is not ~6 1/4&#34;, then you need GE part #WX4-A019 [[ASIN:B001H815TO GE Part Number WX4-A019 UNDER CAB MT]].  If you are replacing a Spacemaker with a distance of ~6 1/4&#34; between the front and back holes, then you probably do NOT need an installation kit.<br /><br />IF YOU ARE REPLACING AN OLD SPACEMAKER II (for which the spacing between the front and rear screw holes is ~7 3/4&#34;)...<br />&#62; I purchased this Profile Spacemaker to replace a 23-year old Spacemaker II.  But neither the holes, backing plate, nor the screws were the same.<br />&#62; The spacing from the cabinet front to the forward screw holes is almost the same for my old Spacemaker II and this new Profile Spacemaker.<br />&#62; The lateral spacing (side-to-side) between the screw holes is the same 19 15/32&#34; for my old Spacemaker II and this new Profile Spacemaker.<br />&#62; But the spacing between the front and rear holes is NOT the same (the new spacing is 6 1/4&#34;).<br />&#62;So, if the holes in your cabinet are for the old Spacemaker II, then you need only drill new rear holes in your cabinet for this Profile Spacemaker.  Draw a line on the cabinet between the centers of the existing front and back holes, measure 6 1/4&#34; back from the center of the front hole, and drill the new hole there.<br />&#62; The screws seem to be very similar, but a slightly different diameter or pitch (perhaps they are metric). Hypothetically, you could drill new holes in the old backing plate (or use washers instead of the backing plate), and find screws the right size and length, but I decided to purchase the new kit instead.<br /><br />BEFORE YOU REPLACE A DEAD MICROWAVE OVEN ...<br />&#62; My old Spacemaker II died three times over 23 years as the result of power surges (lightning).  I accidentally learned that the trick is to unplug the microwave overnight for the electronics to reset.  I've had the same experience with several other appliances.<br />&#62; Even refrigerators and clothes driers have built-in computers these days.  If any electric appliance is not working properly, unplug it, and leave it unplugged a while.  For some reason (perhaps large capacitors in the circuit) big appliances usually need hours to reset.<br /><br />RELIABILITY<br />If my experience with my old Spacemaker II is any indication, this Profile Spacemaker should be very reliable.  Although resurrected 3 times over 23 years, my old Spacemaker was still working when I &#34;took it out of service&#34;.  After 23 years of daily use, some of the white finish was turning yellow, there were patches of rust inside, and the door switch (which turns the light on and off) was erratic.<br /><br />IF YOUR OLD SPACEMAKER HAD A TRAY INSTEAD OF A TURNTABLE, keep the tray from your old microwave.<br />&#62; The tray will fit in your new Profile Spacemaker.  The tray will catch spills and protect the bottom of the microwave from abrasion and burnt-on spills (which may promote rust in the future).<br />&#62; I use the glass tray when I'm using a large rectangular casserole, or many small containers.  I often warm two 12&#34; diameter full plates of food---I use a small glass storage container as a spacer so that the plates can overlap.<br />&#62; If you use the tray, lift out the glass turntable and rollers and turn off the turntable drive, then place the glass tray in the bottom.<br /><br />GENERAL HINTS ON MICROWAVE COOKING<br />It is largely steam created by the microwaves which does the cooking, so the key to cooking many items (especially vegies) is to generate and hold that steam.<br />&#62; If you are warming bread, wrap it in a towel.  It is astounding how effective a single layer of paper towel can be.  If the bread is rock hard, slightly dampen the towel, and use half-power--the warm bread will be soft and fresh.  Heat only briefly and/or at reduced power.<br />&#62; You can even bake potatoes or roast ears of corn-on-the-cob in a microwave, if you wrap them in a damp cloth towel.<br />&#62; Rinse vegetables before you cook them---that washes off any pesticides etc., and the extra water will produce extra steam.  If the vegies are dehydrated after long storage, you may want to soak them a few hours ahead to time to re-hydrate them.<br />&#62; It is usually best NOT to boil vegies in a container of water in a microwave, because the excess formation of steam LOWERS the cooking temperature.  Your goal should be to create a little steam, contain it, and superheat it.

GENERAL HINTS ON MICROWAVE COOKING It is largely steam created by the microwaves which does the cooking, so the key to cooking many items (especially vegies) is to generate and hold that steam. &#62; If you are warming bread, wrap it in a towel.  It is astounding how effective a single layer of paper towel can be.  If the bread is rock hard, slightly dampen the towel, and use half-power--the warm bread will be soft and fresh.  Heat only briefly and/or at reduced power. &#62; You can even bake potatoes or roast ears of corn-on-the-cob in a microwave, if you wrap them in a damp cloth towel. &#62; Rinse vegetables before you cook them---that washes off any pesticides etc., and the extra water will produce extra steam.  If the vegies are dehydrated after long storage, you may want to soak them a few hours ahead to time to re-hydrate them. &#62; It is usually best NOT to boil vegies in a container of water in a microwave, because the excess formation of steam LOWERS the cooking temperature.  Your goal should be to create a little steam, contain it, and superheat it.

Love this little microwave! It is the perfect size (holds just a dinner plate) and LOVE that it does not take up a tremendous amount of room. We don't use it for much other than occasionally heating something up (1-2x month) or steaming vegetables, so I can't speak to how it does for heavy use.
I was looking for the microwave with certain size with a basic function. I was so happy to find this product at Amazon.<br />The first one arrived last week, but I had to return it next day. It made clicking noise when I closed the door. It also make some noises when I push &#34;Start&#34; button.<br />The second one, I received today and connect, set up clock, and start with a cup of water to make sure it works.  I felt bad returning the same product twice.<br />This time, I called Whirlpool customer service. The personnel told me the information she has is the same &#34;product guide&#34; (which comes with the product).
DO NOT BUY!<br />We just got the SE error after 2.5 years - they know about the problem and haven't fixed it.  I looked it up on the internet after this happened and tons of people have this problem.  I'm not going to pull the whole thing apart to fix it and then have it happen again.  If they know the moisture causes the key pad to fail then why do they have it above a range where you boil water!
I ordered and it was very fast shipping about couple days.<br />My turntable engine was broken after 10 years used my microwave.<br />I'm very easy removed old engine and put new one.<br />Quality product and parts was new.<br />Highly recommended this seller.
I was hoping for a powerful travel dryer, like the rest of T3 dryers. I had to return it, not powerful enough for me. You can get much cheaper travel size dryers that will do the same job.
Echoing several other one star reviews, mine failed after less than a year of light use.  Quite disappointing because the features and function are otherwise great.
This dryer was fantastic for the first 6 months. Stopped working after that! I didn't realize there was a warranty card at the back of the user information booklet so I never sent it in. They won't replace this $80.00 hair dryer now. Very disappointed!!!
It is a very good dryer, my girlfriend loved it! Arrived safely in its box with all parts! I highly recommend it!
Magic. Pure magic. Attachments are hard to get off, but I don't want them falling on my feet when I'm drying my hair either. Heat settings in addition to fan speed adjustment are awesome. Cute color and feels great in my hand. Dries my thick mane super quickly!
Works fine.  Replaced a similar older model with this one.  It seems to be a bit lighter than the older one.  Good purchase.
you get what you pay for. It barely lasted outside the warranty period; spend the extra $; it's worth it it
This is a great, great blow dryer. It straightens my hair better than any other blow dryer I've owned. I love it.
I love it. It is neat and out of the way yet always available. The green light is bright but it makes a great night light. It is quiet and has great power.
i took it to costa rica with my, easy to travel with, great and quick dryer! it managed to dry my hair in high humidity.
This dryer is perfect for a first timer's dryer, it does not make your hair frizzy and the temperature i just right. It works well and the cord has just about the right length. Its light and easy to use in small hands and the additional fixtures are great for styling. You don't want a dryer that drys your hair completely some moisture must remain or it will be frizzy.
My biggest disappointment was when I couldn't attach the end cap so that I could concentrate more on the strands of my hair. It's like the hot heat deformed the plastic attachment to where it wouldn't click to the dryer. It became so frustrating. But for the diffuser, it remains to work just fine -- only because I hardly ever use it! I bought this  dryer years ago which is a plus, but I have had issues with it burning some parts my hair. The ion button switches off on its own.  I don't regret buying it, but it's not as great as I'd like it to be. I gave it a 3 stars.
Works great!  Our camper has a small bathroom. I needed a hairdryer that was always up and out of the way.  This one is perfect!
I have owned quite a few Conair products but nevrr again. The cordless wonder has been a problem from the beginning and worked every once in a while. It is less than a year old. I wish I had seen the other reviews before I bought it because I had the same trouble with it. When I called for help I was told to mail back and then they would send me as new one. And in the mean time?The guy had no answer. Duh I have buy another dryer. I have learned a valuable lesson. Research products before you buy them. I wonder if the 20 something 5 star people are still happy with their dryers.
This blow dry is awesome!!! It dries my hair so quickly! I have used blowdryers, but this one beats them by a long shot. I like that it is heavy duty and built to last. Looking forward to having this for a long time.
THE HAIR  DRYER WHICH I purchased from Amazon was just what I needed.  we were able to install it in the same place as the previous dryer ; both were from sunbeam or oster.
This dryer worked well when I got it, but it didn't last. I was very disappointed with it, especially for this price.
Great size and powerful air.  The tools that come with it are very useful and for me don't have a problem staying on.
This dryer gets very hot, very fast and makes drying my hair take less time. My hair felt softer as well. Great dryer.
Not as powerful as others led me to believe. However, it is cute and very easy to travel with. It will be a staple in my suitcase from now on.
I bought this to replace a very compact size that burned out. I mistakenly thought the larger size would mean this new one would be more powerful, but it was not. It does seem to work fine though and I probably shouldn't deduct a star for my misgivings, but I don't love it.
It's a hair dryer, not exactly a cure for the common cold.<br /><br />I like it. It does dry my thick african-american hair very quickly and leaves a shine. I cannot give it five stars because the cord is too short - could be a tad longer - I constantly have to re-plug in the socket.
It's not exactly lightweight, but it's also not a compact dryer. I find the weight to be average. However, I find the warm setting to be very similar to cool when the dryer is on high. On the lower speed, it is warm. And, hot is a bit too hot.
Mine malfunctions. A lot of times when I turn it on to low, it comes on on high and after a few seconds switches to low.
excellent product we got as a gift. She loves it. It was just what she wanted. It works really well.
Absolutely Love it! It drys very well, its super hoot, so if you are not use to using heat protection products Id recommend you do, just to avoid burning your ends- ITs size is PERFECT for travel! it fit so well in a small spot, and is very durable! Id recommend!!
this dryer is: clumsy, clumsy attachements, I don't like the gold paint, it's hard to hold, I never use it.
This hair dryer really packs a punch.  I had used this exact model at a hotel in Dallas and then again in Pensacola and I had to buy it.  I've had it for a few months and it does its job and doesn't get too hot.  It blows a LOT of air and dries in a very efficient time.  I have long, thick, wavy hair and it usually takes me about 15 minutes to dry.  With this dryer I'm down to 8 and mid way through I switch to warm.<br /><br />Excellent dryer for this price!
Great dryer and a great price.  Quiet and gets the job done. I had a Conair that was 6 years old that I used every day and it finally bit the dust. With that kind of reputation it was easy to know what brand to pick.
this is kind of bulky but as long as your not traveling with it it's OK, not a lot of velocity but it gets your hair dry in a decent amount of time
Works  great for curling my hair with the diffuser. Other blow dryers make my hair frizzy, but this one does not.
Was looking for something exactly like this! I have thick, medium length hair and this is perfect to completely dry damp, towel-dried hair. creates less frizz than a standard hair blow dryer and I believe it is faster to dry your hair with this. I originally bought two different Japanese model hair dryers and returned the lower wattage one to keep this one! Just the right strength. It does get hot so keep a continuous, slow pace as you move this throughout your hair and you'll be just fine. highly recommend!
I have had it for about 2-3 months and its just perfect!!! I love the color love the way it works and I am so happy that it has the different heat and strength levels! It dries my hair so fast and it stays flat most of the times even when it's humid outside!
I've been using this dryer 3-4 times a week for about 3 months now.  The Infiniti is quieter, smaller (about 6&#34; high and 5 ¾&#34; long) and lighter in weight than my old dryer, all reasons why I picked the Infiniti.  This dryer is so light-weight that it feels cheap, but so far seems to be working like a champ.<br />  This is my first tourmaline ceramic dryer, and it does seem to leave my hair smoother, but not enough that I'd be willing to toss my flat-iron.  I have thinner hair, about mid length between chin and shoulder, and I am able to dry it pretty quickly with the Infiniti.<br />  I'm a satisfied customer :)
I am so impressed with this hair dryer it's straightened my hair and I don't have to do too much to it it has the speed and the heat that is needed to have a glossy shiny look for my hair I am a cancer patient and this is new hair so it makes it look very sexy and I really like the product.
I wanted a blow-dryer with a lot of power, but without a lot of noise.  This styler delivers on both counts.  There are two heat settings - the warm setting is not much higher than room temperature, and the hot setting is very warm.  There are also two power settings - low is just enough to dry without tangling, and high is perfect for pulling hair straight on a round brush.  The styler is not overly loud, and more importantly, it is without that annoying whine you get with some blow-dryers.  I have no idea if the &#34;Ionic&#34; part of it has any merit, as I haven't noticed that it dries my hair any faster or with less damage.  I have lots and lots of fine-textured, moderately curly hair, and this styler does a great job.
Perfect for vanity top storage! I hated the previous mess of a hair dryer cord all over my BR countertop. Only problem was, the distal opening of this hair dryer was bigger than my old hair dryer holder. So, I got creative and purchased a solid marble drinking cup at Bed, Bath, & Beyond. Problem solved! The solid marble cup is heavy enough to hold down the dryer, it fit perfectly into the interior of the cup, AND eliminated the counter-top clutter of a power cord.
Broke after 6 months. One day it just stopped blowing hot air. Cold air works fine. It was great while it lasted.
This hair dryer not hot enough and the motor was slow.  I have fine hair and when using this it made my hair freezy
Very good hair dryer. Slightly heavier than a DC motor, but we knew that going in. Works great thus far and hopefully will last a lot longer than other dryers!
Looked for a long time for a hair dryer that has a low medium and high heat setting and a low medium and high blower button. This is a great hair dryer dried my hair fast!
This dryer is not as powerful as most but that is a good thing. Leaves my hair soft and shiny, not dried out or frizzy.
It does the job but I find it a little bit heavy to hold. For the rest it is OKAY.<br /><br />Joanne
Excellent buy...this was for my sister and he is in love with it. The product arrived on time and in perfect conditions.
Love these.  The animal provides a little weight so an infant doesn't spit it out.  Also, easy for them to find in the crib at night.
even though I got these for my daughter, they still make her very happy, so it makes me very happy
...what more can you say?  This pacifier is both functional and hilarious.  Sometimes my infant would play with this on her own and when we would look over and she would randomly have it in her mouth.  She could never figure out why we were laughing at her and grabbing for the camera.  SO worth the price!
I was very upset when I received my products because even though I knew that colors may vary, the seller gave me the option among girls and boy colors... I chose boy colors then I received purple and pink pacifiers to my baby boy!!!<br />If I weren't in Brazil, I would return it!
I use these to clean parts between pumping at work and they work great.  Essential item for pumping bag.  I wouldn't use regular wipes but since these are food grade they are safe.
This is a cute one... I got it for my sis-in law I hope she and her husband likes it and most important her baby (who is not even born yet) likes it :-d
The elephant wubbanub is amazing! It is the perfect weight to keep the pacifier in her mouth and at the right angle. We have the duck wubbanub also, but it does not work at well at the elephant!
I had such high hopes for this pacifier after reading some of the reviews that it was good for breastfed babies. Unfortunately my son didn't like it at all. We stayed with the avent pacifiers.
This is a really neat item, even though we ended up not using it. Our baby won't use a pacifier, so we ended up not actually using it, but the concept is really neat! You hang all of the pacifiers on the little &#34;branches&#34; like a tree, then seal the lid closed, with the measured amount of water in it, and microwave, and it sterilizes the pacifiers. They remain sterilized as long as the container is sealed closed, so if you are not going to use them for a few days, you just leave them in. It's really great, and I wish I would have known about it with some of our other babies who did use pacifiers! Highly recommend!
This worked great for my son, but he just does not like pacifiers.  Neither of my boys did.  It was nice to be able to tuck it into a blanket to keep it in his mouth though when he was little.
These are soooo adorable. I got it for a baby shower gift, but have used several myself. Any baby I have had loves them. Quality is great and it is the Original Soothe pacifier.
Dr. Brown makes the best pacifiers.  My son loves the size and shape of the nipple.  He sleeps with then everynight.
These are a little blessing while having a newborn!  Our daughter takes these very well.  They don't sit against their little faces, so moisture doesn't get trapped.  Sad these are only for 0-3 months since our daughter turns 3 months tomorrow.  Hopefully the next step up Avent pacifiers work just as well.
Baby loves these!  She was a little bit on the low birth weight side and we were having a hard time finding something that would fit her tiny mouth.  These fit the bill!  They are nice and soft and she has no problem with them.  She is a breast fed baby and hasn't had any problem so far (introduced the paci around 3 weeks).
I don't like the look of the bear personally. My daughter doesn't use it either. The pacifier sits weird in the bear's hand.
None available.
I love these, they work just like the regular green ones, but I like that my daughter has various colors to match her outfits :)
Love these things! I wish I would have known about these for my 1st child! I have used these for my youngest since she was born and she loves them. We havn't lost one and she can easily spot them in any room. I have bought them as baby shower gifts and people always ask when I got them.
My baby loved her frog and now her Dragon. We took them both to the Houston Renaissance Festival and everyone loved it!<br /><br />Well made and exactly the colors shown. It is easy for her to grab the little feet and is easy to find at night when you are randomly groping in a crib for a pacifier. If you feel the soft happiness, it's your wubbanub. It's small enough that I don't have to worry about it smothering her and perfect for travel. Way easier to find than a normal pacifier.<br /><br />I love them so much, I am getting them for my friends with small babies for Christmas.
these are definitely fine but I found my 2 year old prefers the newborn, softer pacifier. there's nothing wrong wrong with these but they're definitely firmer.
The dragon became one of my son's favorite pacifiers. It's bright and harder to loose. My son loves the wubbaNub
My baby is obsessed with this pacifier now that she is a little older, she always took it but now it's like she prefers it. If she likes it then I love it!
After using this with our newborn to help reduce the number of times we'd have to pick up a dropped pacifier from his mouth while soothing him, we became instant fans.  It's now my go-to gift for moms-to-be.  It's saved our sanity a number of times already!
Got this for my newborn who loves the soothie pacifiers. He already puts his arm around the little froggie. I'm sure he will grow to love his little wubbanub!
have a fiberglass surround so was scared off for a long time.  scerw-in is not an option so got brave and decided to try anyway.  i cleaned and shined up the spots suction cups would go, and first one has been there ever since (2 months).  this review is for my order of a second one- they are wonderful!  they do work great on a shower surround.  in fact i think they work better because the surround has some give.<br />in fact, imo the suction ones would be better than screwing them in through tile trying to hit studs with no second chance.  these do no damage and can be moved if you get them kinda in the wrong place.<br />they stick so well i have a feeling i would pull the whole surround down with me if i started to fall, but do know they are for balance only.  i am sold!
the photograph is spot on and it does fit my britax car seat.  why do i give this bag a 4 star rating after only one use on a short haul flight from guam to tokyo the edging on the bag has a hole, already.  not happy, i am a single mom and on a tight budget and at least once and or twice a year travel on the plane and so this does not make me happy.
these work great. have had to replace some here and there from our son pulling on the too many times. these were the only drawer locks we could use on our cabinets. other brands that needed to screwing didn't fit the way our cabinets were made. (drawers have sliding cutlery drawers...no room to attach other brands)
excellent mattress pad. it is really thick and soft when put on and of course it protects the mattress itself from stains. so i would presume this is a win-win. :) overall, great product and quick delivery.
not sure if it reduced gas but i can see the liner shrink as my baby drinks.  i like that i don't need to wash the bottle but it's hard to tell how much milk is left if my baby finishes half way.
this high chair is superb. it acts as a high-chair, a swing, and a recliner. my toddler daughter still enjoys this chair tremendously, despite not having liked the swing mode when she was a baby. from a parental point of view, there are many positive features, and a couple of negatives. we have been using it for 19 months without any major issues, and i think we will be able to use it for at the very least another year. i bet that we will be able to sell it for a substantial amount when we are done with it, because it has held up really well. we're clearly big fans of this product, and we went on to purchase the car seat, which has also turned out to be a fantastic product.<br /><br />positives:<br />the chair and cover are easily cleaned<br />it is solid and well designed so that it won't break or fall over<br />it folds up to occupy very little floor space (this was really important when we were in a small apartment)<br />it looks and feels great (it feels like soft padded leather, not plastic or imitation velvet like so many others)<br />the table surface is easy to clean<br />the design of this unit is spectacular, and it's really well thought out<br /><br />negatives:<br />the removable tray has plastic alignment pins that don't line up well with the handle brackets<br />the rotating plastic pieces that the plastic alignment pins fit into are cheap and often partly pull out<br />the locking mechanism on the wheels is sometimes difficult to release when moving the unit<br />the levers on the sides for unlocking the base (so that it can fold) are difficult to activate
agree with the 1-2 star reviews.  i've had this for maybe 10 months and the seal/valve is no longer so when you spray it it is massive water coming out of all ends and cracks.  after a few spontaneous bouts of dousing the bathroom and myself, it is unfixable.  for a $50 model i would have hoped for longer wear, but i will try one of the cheaper models for my second one.
my daughter likes the music but is not happy with the upside down elmo, it's not very sturdy and no longer rolls. part of the plastic underside is dragging making it immovable.
this is the best set for a little one. specifically, i buy it for the comb. it gets out all the tangles but doesn't scratch my little ones head. the brush was good when she had little hair because the bristles are so soft it was nice on her head. now it just makes her hair frizzy.
bought it for my son and daughter-in -law and our new grand daughter . kids love it it with the removable car seat, and baby carrier. they also like the hood over the baby carrier. they use the stroller daily on walks. over all a very good system.
these are great to label containers with home made baby food. they come in sheets with different colors- green, blue, yellow, orange, red. there are at least 2 of each color, 6 labels per sheet. i use different colors for different days that i make the food and freeze. you could also use for diff food types like veggies, fruit etc. they peel off great too.
the perfect baby food maker! this is so much fun to use! i made so many batches of baby food!
never got to use it because it shrank on first wash (i washed it exactly according to instructions, gentle cycles on both wash and dryer)!
nuby actually sent me this teether to review, but i've purchased several of their teethers before then, so i'm very familiar with this brand. we have the blue sea horse teether, and it's really cute and colorful! the ring and the shape of the actual teether itself is easy for small hands to grab, and the multiple teething areas are good for cutting different teeth. my son's favorite part is actually the little fabric ties at the top. for some reason, he really likes chewing on fabric.
fits crib perfectly well with square corners. nice and firm on infant side, softer on the toddler side.  high quality product
we've been using this projector for over a year now and love it! the music is soothing, which was great during the long nights of nursing. now that our daughter is a toddler, she loves flipping the pages, turning the night light on and off, and just laying there watching the images on the ceiling. if she wakes up at night, she just turns on the music by herself, and falls back asleep. the remote is a great extra feature. we are expecting another baby, and i will be getting the same projector for him/her as well.
these do the job but they are so pricy! i actually prefer the gerber training underwear over these and they are a fraction of the price at $7 for a three pack).
very sturdy and kept the car seat clean while travelling.  i've now used it about 3 times for international travel and still in good shape. also, there's enough room to put a couple small items once the car seat is in.
very durable, bright colors, relatively easy to assemble if you don't have baby brains.  read the directions if you cannot get it up or down. we obviously skipped a step. my daughter loves sleeping in it. the only negative i have is i wish the flowers that hang down were attached by buttons instead of velcro....they just fall off. i'm sure this will come in handy for many years to come!
great. you can see the entire inside of the car with this mirror. crystal clear. easy to attach. good product.
i so wanted to love this, but once it is wound up you get like 2 seconds of spin. it needs a damper or something to slow it down. so i would wind this thing way up to get more like 5-7 seconds of kick-ass spin. only thing is i broke the rubber bands :-( and you need a crochet hook to string a new one up(comes with 2 extra bands). i broke all three and now my 2 year old lovingly reminds me everytime she takes a bath, &#34;daddy broke it.&#34;
my son loves this, he jumps for 30 minutes at a time in this. perfect gift, he is 7 months old.
a great touch and explore book.  our grandchild really enjoys reading it with us, and he is 10 months old. i would buy another!!
my son loved playing with this before it made its way to the tub.  once it hit the water, it was difficult to get a sound out of the keys so my son quickly lost interest.  when it fills with water, it flips upside down and it is near impossible to get the water out.
a cute and simple baby shower game that got many laughs! just know that it all comes on one sheet, so you must cut out the pacifiers beforehand.
love the product.  it makes my kitchen looks very organized and pretty.  i use it for regular dishes that cannot go into the dishwasher.
very excited to get this bank for our little girls room. can't wait until she finally makes her arrival into the world!
easy to adjust very comfortable,  zipper and with added extension for wider apart breasts.  also have halter straps so don't put it on too tight and cause clogged duct, just use the halter straps!
perfect for my 20 month old, who is approx 26 lbs. warm and comfortable for my little guy. great purchase for parents who do not want to use loose blankets in their little one's crib.
the inside surface is sealed and waterproof. stitching is present on the outside surface, so if the changing pad needs a good hosing, you will have to let it dry. regardless, it closes easily and is quite portable, fitting into any sort of diaper bag or really even a purse.
the gate is attractive and now functional for our smaller dogs.  easier to use than child gates.  reason for 2 stars is that although we like the look and the price was reasonable, it arrived with dented edges and one section's post broken/detached.  we decided to fix with real glue and new screws.  very flimsy and not constructed well.  would not buy another.
easy to assemble.  nothing works 100% of time but this works most of the time.  my baby loves the vibration, and this kind of rock itself if she's moving in it.  there's only 1 thing, i wish it was more of a hammock.  the plastic insert give my baby back support but she hates that she can't kick her legs straight that her weight keeps pushing her down.  but on most day when she's calm this works.  someone will probably call me a bad mom but i use this only when i'm sitting right next to her, --i put her on her side with an extra blanket to pad the bottom.
everything i expected i loved this product just as much as i loved the movie the lion king when i was a kid.
my baby refused to sleep on hard surfaces like the pnp mattress. this sheet gave it a nice plush softness and cushion so that she'd finally take a nap.
for the price, it was pretty good.  it does pull down on the shoulders quite a bit.  so good for short term wears.  i made a video review of it if you would like to see how it works http://youtu.be/p5honchd2x0
super duper cute.  my little girl is going to love it at christmas.  if i know her, she'll be wearing it all the time.
we've been using this product for about a week now and so far so good! the foam pieces are a little on the thin side but because there are so many in a pack i just put two on the door and it works great (previous reviews mention this as well). you can't beat the price on these and they're super cute for kids. they store very easily on the door knob when not in use.
this is a very nice high chair.  babies sit very comfortable in it.  the tray is easy to handle and the chair itself fold up nice and neat.  stands by itself and can be stored very easily.  i was very impressed with how easy it unfolds and folds up.  the wheels make it very portable and the adjustable seat height is nice.  i cannot find anything about it that i don't like and our grandson seems to feel the same way! :)
I am very pleased and this was a good purchase.  I bought it for my granddaughter.  She was very happy!
The pacifier is very cute, however was a little overpriced for the quality.  I don't think that I would purchase again.
Great pacis, they hold up well and don't get sticky with use.  I do not like that soapy water gets in it, but I just put it underwater with clean water and suck that up and then squeeze on the &#34;nipple&#34; part to shoot it back out.  These are my kid's preferred paci; she'll spit out the Avents or the Soothies.
My baby wasn't big on the pacifiers. We tried pretty much every brand out there and these are all she would take. We are still using mam at 3 months and loving them.
Good product for a good price, with 2 pacifier! My baby like it! My baby boy likes to hold the pacifier with his owns hands so is anatomic
My baby loves this pacifier! I love the simple look and quality of the rubber. This is very durable, so far this pacifier has had no cracks or pieces broken.
My son loves these pacifiers! When he was newborn, I could spread the legs out on top of his little swaddled body and it would help keep the pacifier in his mouth and help him find it again easily before he was able to use his hands. In the Car, it is MUCH easier to find when you can't see (for example, searching the crib in a dark room or with one hand reaching to carseat in the back while driving). He did go through a short phase when he was learning to grasp where he would pull it out of his mouth and not be able to get it back in, but as he got older it because much easier for him to put these back in at night without waking up.
Maybe it's because my baby is super fidgety, but this doesn't really do a whole lot for keeping the paci in her mouth.  Maybe when she's a little older, she will be able to put it back by herself.  She is 2 months and unless you have a baby who is swaddled and doesn't move, this doesn't do much.  I had such high hopes too, but I guess I'll still be getting up every 10 seconds to put the paci back in her mouth.
Granddaughter ADORES it! I believe it is her favorite to have! Well worth the cost for a child to enjoy so much!
Very cute and durable. My daughter loves the little animals and she cuddles with them to. A++++ product and would get them again
The best pacifiers, but you already knew that. Buy a dozen as half of them will end up under the couch.
Our 3 month old LOVES her lambie! We always have it with us and she even holds onto it when she doesn't want the binky in her mouth. The little legs make it easy for her to grab onto... It's a nice little security item for her. Obviously a plus that lambie helps to keep the binky from falling to the ground.
I love knowing my son is getting the best when it comes to natural pacifiers. We've had these for a few months now and they've held up perfectly. They do turn darker once they're washed in hot water. But, this doesn't have any wear and tear on them.
My toddler seems very happy with the AVENT pacifiers. Somehow, the price seems more reasonable than the other AVENT ones.
My baby loves these over the traditional pacifiers but he also uses the AVENT bottles. The only draw back is there are difference in manufacturing from when I have bought spares a month a part. The base has been difference thicknesses and the baby can tell the difference since he will spit out the thicker ones.
Love It!! We also have the little lamb. My grand daughter is two months old and already she holds on to it. And it's a life saver because you can always keep track of it.
These are the greatest things!! My son loves his binky and so having a big animal on the other end helps him from dropping it on the floor and makes it easy for him to pick up and put in his mouth on his own. I put it in his crib at night and he can pick it up and put it right in his mouth. I had to buy two of these things because they are so great!
Great for one pacifier.  I attach it  to the car seat and it stays put.  It's easy to clean and I love it.  It's my favorite pacifier holder
Great value, these are my daughters favorite pacifiers because they are identical to the ones the hospital provides. Awesome buy!
They are easy to handle. He finds them and plays with them or puts them in his mouth. I like them cause I can tie a clip string so we don't loose them when we r out. I also like the translucency because I take a lot of pict of my son and you can still see his features versus the non transparent pacifiers. I have it a four because the oval colors need to be brighter so they can be easier for baby to see and find.
I have a lot of trouble finding this kind of paci in stores.  I wish I hadn't gave my son this kind because he won't take any other now.  They are great pacifiers though.  Also don't get your hopes up on the color you want.  my son got pink.  It's not a big deal but some moms are very picky. I was just pretty desperate because I can never find these at local stores so I didn't care about the color.
My daughter loved these binkies.  It is like a toy and binky all in one.  She was able to grasp thing faster.  She might not had the binky part all the time but she would grab the cow toy with her hands.
My daughter loved these binkies.  It is like a toy and binky all in one.  She was able to grasp thing faster.  She might not had the binky part all the time but she would grab the cat toy with her hands.
I use these wubbanub pacies for my babies in their bed because it is easier to find it at night. I love them for that reason!
my baby loves this she wont go to sleep without it glad i purchased this it is cute and easy to find when they drop the pacifier
It is exactly what I was looking for.  It was the perfect gift for  the baby shower it was purchased for.
Really liked the item. It is very simple to attach to any bags or purses and take with me anywhere.
The billy bob two front teeth pacifier, arrived and is a great gift! It was a hit at the baby shower!
It is nice and deep so pacifier won't fall out even if the Velcro is not closed. Light weight, also due to Velcro. Fit around any diaper bag strap or a belt loop.
For some reason my boy didn't like it ..  it is soft and he can play with it for a wile ..  I'm still trying to replace hand and fingers ..  but to be honest they are winning so far ..
this is the second one of these I am buying because my son loves it so much! I had to replace the first one because I washed it one too many times and the pacifier came off. He was not happy about that... so on to number two!
My grand daughter loves this pacifier, it really cute you can't loose it with the animal on there.  Good item for kids.
Perfect. Quick shipment. Product just as described. If you intend to use a pacifier for your baby these are a must have!!!
These are the best binkis around.  My daughter is breast fed exclusively and she has been taking these binks since she was about two months and has never wanted any other kind. We have tons of them now and they clean easily. We bought a cheap clevamama microwave sterilizer for binks from this site and they fit right on the branches inside it and clean up beautifully.
These are great.  I purchased two, because you never know when you might need to bring one with you.  We use Soothies for pacifiers, which EASILY collect pet dander or anything else on the floor.  These cases are great because I can pop the Soothie in there and throw it into my purse or my daughter's diaper bag.
we love it so far (a few months in) and the smaller screen is totally worth the savings, im not sure what an extra sq cm of screen would really do for us.<br /><br />things i love<br />- the thermometer - i thought that it was useless when i read that it was a feature but  now that i can see the temperature in his room on monitor - i love it and i adjust our thermostat accordingly.<br />- good night and day coverage<br />- zoom - use it all the time<br />- the long cord on the monitor - the battery suffices until i go to bed and then once im in bed the long cord is useful.<br /><br />things i would change<br />- the buttons are not backlit (it is too easy to accidentally send music into his room in the middle of the night instead of zooming in like i had intended - not to mention i think the music function is useless).<br />- a clock -  i wish it had the time on the monitor.  (would also be cool if it had a timer you could start when he falls asleep that way you would know exactly how long he has been down).
i was planning my daughter's baby shower (our first grandchild) and had ordered a honey favor from another company online.  it was about a week before the shower was to take place and i realized that the items had not arrived, now approx. three weeks late.  i tried to contact the company several times but was never able to get any response online or by phone ( i immediately went to my bank of course to cancel the charges from this obvious scam).  in a panic i began to search the internet for another company that stocked a similar honey favor.  what a blessing when i found the holy honey company!  i called the telephone number listed and much to my amazement i not only got to speak with a real person but it was the owner of the company.  she was amazing, helpful, kind,  considerate, and assured me that i would receive the product in time for our baby shower.  we received the items days before the shower, they were beautiful and all of our guests loved this unique little gift and of course the tasty honey.  god bless you holy honey for being so wonderful and &#34;saving the day.&#34;
the product was exactly what i thought it would be regarding quality and value.  i what recommend this for the bob/peg combo.
i feel so much more comfortable at night since buying this one. especially while co-sleeping, and while transitioning to the crib.
i ordered this for a co-worker's baby shower. the co-worker is having a boy and the shower was race-car themed, so it seemed perfect. unfortunately, when the gift was unwrapped, the beanie and bib and shoes were all pink. it is not gender neutral and now i'm left embarrassed.
this gate seems very sturdy and the auto close feature is very nice.  once thing to note is that it does appear more black then brown but still looks very nice.  only drawback is that the bottom brackets screw through the baseboards which is not too desirable but overall this is a good product.
neutral colors were excellent.  best price for these diaper.  the stand up to wear and my husband and day care love the easy use.
i've been looking for a couple backpack harnesses for my son for a while.  there are a lot of cute ones out there but i wanted something a little different.  when i spotted this i knew i had to try it out.  i was a bit worried because the price seems too good to be true - including shipping!  but i needn't have worried, it's a great item.  we've used it a couple times and it's nice and sturdy and just so stinkin' cute!!
two friends of mine had these on their baby registries, so of course, since i think they are the greatest thing since sliced bread, i snatched them off of both registries and just gave them as gifts.  so cute.  so soft. love them. have even considered getting them to swaddle my dog...just kidding.  she doesn't like to be swaddled.
after nearly two years of use, i couldn't be happier with this bag. it always has enough room and everything has a place without having unnecessary pockets or folds. it's lightweight, smaller in size than a lot of diaper bags, and durable. we still use this with a toddler (even for longer trips) and plan to continue using it after he no longer needs it. we take it everywhere and love it. easy to wipe down and can be thrown in the washing machine too. this is my favorite baby item. it's not at all frou frou, but it does the job perfectly, with ease.
we loved, loved, loved this glider.  my daughter fell asleep in it immediately, then lost interest, then went right back to it.  i wanted one for myself.  it's been great.  unfortunately, after having it less than 3 months, the wiring for the music stopped working.  we tried batteries, ac plug, etc., but it's the wiring. (once the music came on randomly with lots of static, and then shut off again).  i called graco.  getting hold of anyone is a challenge because their hours are limited and then they were closed additional hours for staff training.  seriously?  this is a big company.  anywho, just reached someone.  they will send me a new motor - oops, it's out of stock and will take 4-6 weeks to get in.  ok, i say, can't you send me a new one?  yes, we can send you a prepaid fed ex envelope.  that will take 7-10 business days to get to me.  then, i box up the swing and use the label (fed ex ground) to send it back.  then, they will fed ex ground a new one to me.  let's be very generous and say this will take 24 days.  in a baby's life this is a long time.  these things have a limited life to them, so not having it for 24-42 days is ridiculous for a $120 or whatever item.  super disappointed in graco and certainly will make a difference when i am weighing the purchase of a graco item over another item.
i bought these for our granddaughter and she loves them.  she enjoys them in the bathtub as well as in the pool and at the lake.
this really helps me out in my shower. i am handicapped and i can now reach my water wand in the shower.
i ordered this for when my 4 month old grandbaby comes over to visit. she really likes this bouncer! the vibration and music seem to soothe her if she happens to be a little crabby and/or tired. the little hanging toys are nice and bright and really keep her attention too.
i ordered this along with other items on my daughter!s baby registry.  it does just what it says, it soothes, great product and comes two in a package, just in case one gets misplaced!
this carseat was an excellent choice for us because we're interested in extended-rear facing. our one-year old is very petite and we expect this carseat to continue to be the perfect one for her.
this is a nice rattle because it's soft.  babies can't control their motions well but as they age a bit they get some real oomph behind their arm swings.  this rattle is soft so no worries of bruises or smashed fingers when baby pounds this rattle around. we like this and our daughter does too -- she's six months.
i still have a soft spot in my heart for all things winnie the pooh cudnt resist getting this adorable stuffed animal for my niece she loves it!
these little diaper covers are well-made, sturdy, and attractive. the design used to make the velcro-style closure tabs is ingenious. they are double sided, so one will stick to the other if you need to overlap them for a better fit on a smaller baby! i absolutely love these!!!
super cute and comfy. my son loves it because he can see out of the window much easier. it also feels much safer and sturdier than the bucket carseat. highly recommend.
it is sturdy and safe for children. the table has a washable surface, which is a must with toddlers. the assembly was relatively easy and the table has clean lines and fits in anywhere. the price is fantastic.
very cute addition to my 2 year old's minnie room! she loves the bright colors and, of course, minnie everywhere.
i received this in a timely manner; and was very pleased with the product. it works perfectly in my grandson's bedroom. very pretty and well made.
we had another seat that just sat in the bathtub for our newborn which she hated, so i decided to buy her a little tub of her own. she loves this!  the water stays around her tushy to keep her warm (which the other seat didn't do so i think that's why she hated it) and she enjoys kicking her feet in it to splash water everywhere. :)  i also love that it will adjust by taking out the spacer as she gets older. highly recommend!
i have purchaed other advent products and had great experiences. but this was not the case with this product i'm uncertained if it's a manufactures defect because it leaks. my daughters always has spills on her blouse when ever she use it. i'm tring to wean her into cups so i thought this would be ideal but it's not effective.
push it is... fit the changing pad that i bought perfectly and it is nice and soft to lay my son down.
fits the secure beginning's mattress perfectly and is very easy to put together.  the crib is very rugged although there is one board that supports the mattress that they leave raw wood and could use some stain.
These were adorable! My baby girl will be wearing these for baby pictures (military family) they are just slightly bigger than I expected, but knew for an infant they would be!<br />I'm still very pleased and excited for pictures
This product arrived promptly and my 1 month old has loved it ever since.  It is much easier to keep up with this paci with the giraffe attached!  We use it during the day when he is being supervised.  I read reviews about people letting their kids sleep with them but I am too scared.  I worry he will try to eat the giraffe or something (I'm probably being ridiculous).  Anyway, great product and SO CUTE.
My son loves these pacifiers - they are just pink with cherry's and other girly items. We are using them because we dont mind people thinking he is a girl from time to time but... just so you are aware (in case you care) the cute blue, white and yellow pacifiers you see in the picture may come to you in pink and purple. :D
This is the perfect size for a newborn or toddler. My grandbaby is only 3 weeks old and already holds the giraffe. I would recommend this product. Its also not easily lost in the diaper bag or crib.
Bought these for a baby shower. Couple went to South Carolina and are expecting their first child.  These are great and are being sent to a baby shower in California.
This is one of the best inventions ever. It pacifies the baby as well as giving him something to hang on to.
I can never have enough of these on hand. I keep four of them around for my twins. I love that they help stay put with infants and they additionally seem to be soothing and give them something to grab on to. Also a lot harder to lose, and a lot easier to find in a diaper bag full of stuff! A must have for a shower gift.
Can't wait to see a little baby with this in their mouth. It looks just like the picture and it will be a fun shower gift.
My daughter loves them, but I don't.  They never stay in her mouth, as soon as she doses off and stops sucking, it falls right out, I hate it!! I have tried to get her to take other pacifiers...nope!  She gives them 4 stars...I'd give them 1.
I got it for my new nephew who has it at all times. It was recommended by my cousins whose son and daughter were big fans with it.
Have twin 5 month old boys and this pacifier is the best in aiding us in distinguishing whose is whose and best of all...it's hard to lose! It's also easy for the boys to hold which is great since they are just now grasping with their hands and discovering textures.
It's great because she can hold onto it which means its less likely to fall, so no more dirty pacifiers!

This is the brand the hospital gave us. Also, it is the only paci that my newborn will take (if he decides to take one at that moment lol).<br />Very easy to clean, so far very durable. Would definitely recommend.
Baby likes it, so I like it.<br />Only Con was that they develop water spots on the inside fairly quickly, just sanitize and reuse.
I like the patterns and colors of Ella Bella. Baby would have liked it better if the truck was straight it was  difficult keeping it in her mouth.
CUTE FUN AND GOT LOTS OF AWWWs at the BABY SHOWER. I put pink bows around froggie's neck and made it perfect for a little girl baby who's mom decorated her room in green and pink!
Creative!  I have given quite a few of these pacifiers as gifts.  It's so cute how little ones can hold on to these.
No more lost paci!  It is also more difficult for it to fall out of her mouth.  Now that she is a little older, she loves to rub it and snuggle it.
we love these pacifiers.  Can never have enough of them.  The six pack makes it a little easier to always have a clean one.
One of the cutest pacifiers out there.  Have bought quite a few of the Wubbanub pacifiers and they are high quality, durable and everyone I have given one to loves them.
the product is exactly as shown and described on the site. I'm sure my baby boy will enjoy it once he is born : )
perfect size, holds two nuk pacifiers and it saves a great deal of time and frustration when needing to grab a paci real quick. The snap isn't too hard and the material is nice.  It can easily be wiped down with a damp cloth to clean.
This was such a fun purchase and my baby looked hilarious wearing it at our redneck themed party! This is good for a laugh but I wouldn't spend much money for it.
I thought the pacifier part would not be appealing since, my daughter hates every pacifier. She loves it! She snuggles with the frog at night even if she is not using the pacifier
These are the only paci's that our baby girl will take.  Everything else she spits out of her mouth pretty much immediately.  I'm not sure if it's the shape of the nipple (or what) but she loves them.  We also bought MAM bottles after finding out she loves the pacifiers so much.  The nipple for the bottle is the same as the pacifier. Plus the bottles are anti-gas/anti-colic bottles that allow air to release from the bottom.  They are great at keeping our baby from swallowing air and making her gas even worse.
I like this pacifier because the stuffed animal makes it extremely easy for infants to grab. This is the second one I've bought.
Good quality product and very very cute and snuggly. Could also cute the giraffe off the nuk when you are phasing them out which may stop some tantrums
Parents, if your baby likes to put their hands by their face and move their arms a lot, this probably won't work. My son pushes binkibear away and the pacifier falls out.
I got this bc I wanted to keep my baby's pacifier on hand just incase she wanted it. I keep it hanging on my diaper bag so I always know where it is and never leave the house without it. I was able to fit 4 small pacifiers 0-3 months ones, I'm sure ill be able to fit less as she gets older n they get bigger.
These were the only pacifiers my daughter could use because she was so tiny when she was born! The traditional pacifiers have such a wide nipple that it wouldn't fit in her mouth! Perfectly pink. Will definitely use with all my future children too!
Just the cutest thing and the baby took to it well. Easy to find with little animal attached to it.
Easy to find in carseat while driving! And easy for them to find in crib in the middle of the night!
THIS PACIFIER IS VERY FUNNY LOOKING. EVERYONE WHO HAS SEEN IT THINKS ITS THE COOLEST THING EVER. PRICE IS DECENT TOO
Bought this for my grandson who's due next month. His mommy wanted an Alabama themed nursery and this fit in well with the bedding set I bought on Amazon. It's cute, looks sturdy enough and has the type of pacifiers we wanted to use,
While she doesn't seem to be suffocating, these pacifiers don't seem to have a deep enough cut out for my daughter's nose. It seems like it must be uncomfortable. I am really disappointed because she loves the older model of this pacifier (hand me downs from her sister) but I can't find them anywhere now!
These are the exact same Pacifiers that come from the NIC-U (Hospital). Our little one got used to this one and only this one. therefore we needed more.
If your child likes a binky, then this product is for you. It is a lifesaver on long car rides - prevents mom or dad from having to fumble around in the car seat for a lost binky. It stays on baby's chest, and she can even put it back in all by herself sometimes (3 months old). It's also easy to clean and very cute. Love the WubbaNub... I just wish I had thought of it first! :)
Can't stop laughing. Such a cute idea. Great gift. My 15 month hasn't taken it out since I put it in an hour ago. So adorable. Lots of laughs on the afternoon walk today :)
Great product was exactly what I was looking for. Fast service will recommend to others. I will be leaving more from this company.
Bought this for grandson. Had one just like it for my son when a baby and it was his fav thing as it is with my grandson. Very flexible and well made.  Highly recommend.
I could have gotten this stuffed bear from the dollar store! its not soft at all, overstuffed so my child cannot even use it, and the material is so awful and cheaply made that it already has a hole in it. don't waste your money.
this camera (god bless its creators) is hte reason we were able to get a full night's rest after a year of getting up every 2 hours.  it was clear that we had to ferberize so we got this camera and when our kid would cry, we were reassured that she's ok by quickly glancing at the camera.  this product rocks!
this is the best gate.  it looks great and does what it says it will do.  the slats are just the right width that my japanese chin don't fit through them.  once i figured out the hanging instructions it was easy.  a must buy!
good product. as expected. no compains. if you compare prices and is the best, there is no hold back to it.
i'm a first time mom so, for what it's worth, i don't have much to compare this to. but i love this travel system. it's very easy to use and the stroller is such a smooth ride, much more so that i thought it would be. it's so smooth and easy to push, i was able to push my baby with one hand while walking my two big dogs with the other. i like having the piece of mind knowing that my son is safe riding in a quality product.
i just received this product two days ago. the first night we got it, we didn't use it because we thought it needed to charge overnight. tonight, we unplugged it and were excited to start using it only to figure out that there is no rechargeable battery inside.  it has to stay plugged in to work. in fact, there isn't even a temporary memory to remember the time settings once you've taken the time to set it. i am floored that a product meant to help toddlers who get out of their beds and have free reign in their rooms has to have a cord attached! can you say choking hazard?!?! we're still desperate to see if it works, so maybe i'll give a better rating after we spend our precious parent time tacking the cord to the wall and go through the teaching process.<br /><br />another minor complaint...after one time in my daughter's hands, the bottom cover that provides access to the clock was broken. not very child resistant on that piece. it's not a huge deal, but annoying enough to mention.<br /><br />a couple of good things to mention:  it came wrapped like a present, making it very exciting for my daughter; and when i posted a question to their fb site, it was answered within an hour or so.
its a nice bag but it was too small for me so i returned it and exchanged it for a jj cole caprice diaper bag-vintage poppy (i love it).
we bought the basic safety lock for our doors and our 1 year old quickly figured out how to break them in half.  however he can't figure these ones out!<br />i do have one complaint:  it's a pain to lock.  the cover is very hard to open and doesn't open far enough to easily lock the door.  also, if you have push locks, kids can hit the knob and lock it.
i bought 3 of these latches but they are completely unuseful for the type of cabinets i have at home so basically i wasted my money because i cant use them!! the knobs in my kitchen cabinets are too wide (they are rectangular) and so the latch is not large enough to cover them, therefore it is impossible to use them. i even tried cutting them but it did not work either. waste of money! i cant even use them in other parts of my house!
we love this brand but these are bottles with medium flow nipples and are not suitable to newborns. they also require drop in liners by ziploc that are not sold in stores.
i was preparing to return to work, and my ebf 5 month old was having trouble with every bottle that we tried. finally, we tried sippy cups.  this one was the best because it has a soft spout.  also, it only holds 5 oz, which is about the amount my daughter eats at each sitting.  the smaller size means that the amount tips into her mouth more easily.
i havent used these yet but i was pleasantly surprised. i bought a pack of plain ones at babies r us for my first child and these are for my coming baby. these are very soft and cushy i cant wait to put them on her carseat!
i really have never written a scathing review before and i really wanted to like the 2012 inglesina zuma white highchair, but my wife has really let me know on a daily basis how unhappy she is with it.  we have twins, so we purchased two of them!  the price was pretty good, and the quality seemed like it was constructed well. we really were taken in by the looks and style and it matched our kitchen. the engineering is just dreadful.<br /><br />1. the maneuverability is difficult because it's an awkward design with the extended legs. you just can move it quickly or easily.<br />2. setting it up and storing it takes several steps and one of them sometimes requires repeating over an over because of an internal latch mechanism that doesn't always release. it's a real pain.<br />3. cleaning the seats is a chore because you have to remove the straps and speaking of straps...<br />4. straps are a magnet to babies and these are very long and floppy. we had to use velcro straps to keep the kids from sucking on them. also, it would be nice to have a padded shoulder strap so it would prevent the strap from sometimes cutting into the child's neck.<br />5. cracks everywhere!! the top tray and sides are designed in such a way that food will get into every nook and cranny. this drives my wife nuts!<br /><br />we could never recommend this highchair to anyone because it costs too much money to have all of these issues.<br /><br />this is only our opinion and you may not care about any of these things. it's a really cool looking highchair!
i  needed a drying rack for all the bottles, pacifiers, spoons, etc. my baby has. it works great, fits perfectly on my kitchen counter, spins with no problem. and if you have tall bottles, they fit too!<br /><br />i would buy it as a gift for a friend who's going to have a baby, with no doubt!
muy util para limpiar la nariz del bebe, lo unico es que hay que tener cuidado con el recipiente deposito de fluidos, el mismo es un poco delicado en el sistema de cerrado, se rompen las pestaÃ±as y queda impedido para mantener el deposito en posicion.
im a mom of 2 boys who weigh 37lbs and 25lbs, im just 5ft tall as well. jogging with the boys has been so easy for me comparing it to other jogging strollers. i completely love the stroller, it does look big but most side by side strollers look big. the stroller fits just fine through the front door, we have a suv so we have plenty of space when we take it with us.
ya the inc ones 24mm too freaking small...these are too huge...get 27 mm unless you've got mammoth freaky huge nipples!!
i bought this hoping it would make traveling from bwi to houston easier with just me and a 2 year old. it was a nightmare. i can't really blame this strap, but it is not very long and you have to tilt the arm very far down to walk when using it so it's impossible to walk comfortably. also, in the pic it shows pushing the seat like a cart, in reality you have to drag it behind you because when you exert that much force to push suitcase, seat and child, the handle automatically slides back into the luggage. i wouldn't recommend this for anyone traveling alone. pulling that around is a job all on its own.
i love the product but the lid does not feel solid. it does not leak as long as it is held mostly upright.
did not realize that full-sized, folding cribs were even available.  this one is very nice looking, solid and easy to fold.  it was exactly what i was looking for when my grandchildren visit.  my only slightly negative comment would be that it would have been nice to have hardware (hooks?) to hold it together when folded up.  i used a velcro strap.
in my haste to order an outfit my 5 month old son could wear for his baptism, i purchased this using my prime membership so it would arrive in two days.  i should have read the reviews first!  as previous reviewers mentioned, the 6-12 month size was much too small for my 5 month old who wears 6-12 month clothing in just about every brand imaginable.  the \\top\\ portion fit well, but the legs barely went past his knees and the lack of middle button on the rise meant that his diaper stuck out of the jumpsuit. on the plus side, the jumpsuit was really cute and the cabled cotton was soft.  please add some length to the legs and a middle button!!!
these little clothes are perfect in the baby wipe warmer. not too big, thicker than the spa silk clothes and wash up nicely.
None available.
I wish I had read recent reviews prior to purchasing this.  Check for yourself:  the extension does not fit!!  The male coupling of the extension belt does not seat into the female coupling of the carrier.  I bought a brand new galaxy grey ergobaby organic carrier.  Since I can't return the carrier (outside the terms of returns), I am stuck with something that won't fit.  I'm hoping a luggage repair shop or professional seamstress can help...

The kid loves it in the car when we are driving. This is a great product for a baby thanks.
This is the first soother that my daughter ever used. Just the right size for newborn baby's mouth! Plus, only weeks after she was born, she was able to hold onto it herself because of the attached teddy! She grew out of it by 3 months of age though as the spout/knob part that goes into baby's mouth was too small and/or just wasn't a comfortable suck anymore.
This pacifier was definitely one of my best finds while registering for gifts.  It's our go-to car seat pacifier.  It sits on her chest well, making it easier for her to recover after spitting it out accidentally and making it less likely to fall on the floor.  The elephant gives me something to easily grab from the drivers seat while reaching back as she cries on her way home from daycare.  Suprisingly, it also helped in her development of learning how to reach/grab and becoming more coordinated.  She's now four months old and still loves this Soothie pacifier, although she also uses MAM pacifiers in the house.  I held out for a couple months, but just gave in and purchased another WubbaNub last week.<br /><br />It would be wonderful if the pacifier could be separated from the animal for easier cleaning, but this doesn't deter me from recommending it to all of my friends.
With our first we used the Soothies pacifier, but always felt like it was in his nose, so when I saw these later on I figured it would be worth trying with our second.  These are what our hospital now gives out, so I figured it was a good recommendation.  We offered it to our newborn when he was about a week old and he took it well.  He was a little tongue-tied and it still didn't affect his sucking on these.<br /><br />My one complaint is that the edges if you play with them a lot you can start to feel the silicone breaking and letting the plastic piece that creates the shape poke out a bit.  We've been using them for 3 months and they are okay so far, but do wonder if I will have to buy more before he gives them up.
My son is 2.5 and still has to have these everynight.  SO 5 stars it is these put him to bed peacefully everynight..... I know we are needing to get rid of them I just dread the day we dont have them. lol.
i order this because it is BPA free , not some other products that are not BPA free,<br />shipped faster than expected.
Was a present for my new great-nephew, and per his mother, he loves it!  Seems to calm and quiet him.
I scoffed at these when I first saw them online, but was compelled to check it out after reading rave review one after another. They're the best. They are easy to find, they don't roll when they hit the ground, and much easier for my daughter to get in her mouth on her own. We have two for wash days and I couldn't live without them.
This is the only pacifier my daughter will use and the caterpillar is so cute! The shape makes it easy for her to get her hands on, which at 6 weeks is amazing. I know other people who have wubbanubs and they love them too!
I originally choose Avent because of the Orthodontic recommendations. I had previously used the AVENT Orthodontic Infant Pacifier for 0-6 months. The (0-6 months) pacifiers had symmetrical nipples as well as mouth guards, so no right side up or upside down. As my baby grew and it seemed as if he was almost able to swallow the whole pacifier I knew it was time to get a larger size. So because he had been using the Avent ones with no difficulty I purchased, what looked like, the same product but in a larger size. But that wasn't exactly the case. The NIPPLE was symmetrical but the mouth guard was not. It wasn't a huge deal really, I didn't return the products. We purchased both the clear and clear with blue center. The blue colored ones were easier to find, especially at night.<br />I will say that we are lucky that our baby decided he didn't want/need to use pacifiers at 8.5 months on his own.<br />These were very useful for us while we needed them. We boiled, hand washed and cleaned in dishwasher and there was not any  discoloration or visible breakdown of product with daily use and wash for 3 months.
My son absolutely LOVED this pacifier. I wish I knew about it with my other two kids! It is so adorable & easier to find for me & the baby!
Fast ship, great price on this pacifier! I was looking for something different for a baby shower and this went over great!
No more lost pacifiers! With twin boys, I need to know that I have spare pacifiers on hand and I am able to fit four extra pacifiers in this pocket. And I always know where they will be as it conveniently snaps onto the strap of my diaper bag and stays put!
Godchildren love the products NUK has wonderful products. The only issue was the site should allow customers to select the color.
They should replace &#34;colors may vary&#34; with &#34;colors are opposite to what you see&#34;..<br /><br />Truly disappointing..<br /><br />They seem to be good quality but receiving the blue ones instead of the yellow ones that appear in the picture has ruined it!
We have always been familiar with the Vanilla Soothie pacifiers as they are given out by the hospital we delivered at. We used them with our first child back in 2006 and have continued the tradition with our more recent arrival. Our kids have NOT liked any other pacifiers and were extremely fickle as to which one they take, but the Soothies have never failed us.<br /><br />I have never had one of the pacifiers degrade in any way. Generally we toss them long before that point (shortly after the Vanilla scent goes away), so we can definitely attest to the durability of the pacifiers. Completely worth every penny spent!
She loves these pacifiers. They seem to just make her feel so much better. All the fussing stops as long as we keep her Avent nearby.
I bought this based on a recommendation from a freind. I think its a good haridryer, I have had no issues. My last one that just stopped working was considerably  more expensive than this one so just comparing the two this one comes out on top for sure. Lots of air flow and a large handle thats comfortable in the hand.
Lightweight and compact but powerful.  Used one in a hotel and immediately ordered one when I returned home. After years of using a hair dryer, this is myall time favorite.  I use it most every morning and love it.  Plus, it was reasonably priced.
This is not a compact travel hair dryer, but for home use it's sleek, lightweight, and powerful. It has all the features anyone would need, and it's easy to handle.
The dryer works efficiently and is easy to pack. The unit does not have the power of my older traveler hair dryer, but is more than adequate.<br /><br /> I would buy this product again.
I purchased as a back up for the last one I bought.  I shuts of when it gets to hot.
I have wavy hair that can be coaxed into curls or dried straight. This hairdryer works for both, and dries quickly whether for curly or for straight hair. The diffuser is wonderful. I can put my hair into it and my hair stays without blowing out of it. I get nice, voluminous curly hair. There is a wide range of  blower strength and heat available for this hairdryer, and for blowdrying straight, I need to use one notch below the maximum for both. Otherwise, my hair blows everywhere. Despite the blower strength, the hair dryer is pretty quiet and fairly light. The cord is nice and long. One last thing--I already knocked this hair dryer off my counter top, and it survived, seemingly without any problems.
Not using is regularly but its serving the worth of the price. its is small and easy for carrying during the travel.
Love it!  Lighter th!an I thought a dryer could be.  Lives up to it's reputation...dries my  thick hair in record time
Hot but not too hot.  Lightweight.  Compact.  Only flaw- would like more focused air stream.  Otherwise...just right.  Hope it has a long life.
I'm traveling to Europe and I need a hair dryer with diffuser. I really like it! is not heavy, easy to handle. Is hot but you can change it to a low temperature. Best part, voltage for US and Europe. Just love it! very cute!
MY WIFE LOVE IT SHE TRY IT IMMEDIATELY ON MY DAUGHTER THEY LOVE IT. REALLY WORTH YOUR MONEY TRY IT.
Handy & convenient.  Love the cord hanger, I use it to hang my flat iron.  Very good product for the cost.
This unit performs well and was easy to install.  We especially like the magnet &#34;latch&#34; which holds the dryer into the wall mount.  There are no plastic latch parts to break and you don't have to push the dryer into the mount to lock it into place.
I bought this for traveling. I have very thick hair that takes a long time to dry. This blow dryer is light weight but still does a good job of drying my hair.
I have kinky curly 4a hair.<br />pros:<br />I was looking for a blow dryer that had a lot of power to dry my hair quicker and make my hair less frizzy. This blow dryer does a great job drying my hair faster and it makes my hair softer and straighter. It can get very hot. Lots of power. I like that it has four heat settings. Its also very sturdy<br />cons:<br />a little heavier than I expected but its not too bad. Its four speeds but you have to play around with it to get the right speed that you want because you cant tell which is the low, medium, and high speed.<br /><br />other than that I really like this blow dryer
I actually use this in the garage for drying glues, paints and finishes, replaced a unit I had for years, works great
I bought thus dryer after using it at a hotel and decided I must have it.  I love the way the handle folds for easy packing into my suitcase, the cool button is easy to reach and my hair does not get frizzy!  Did I mention the retractable cord, another feature that I love!  I highly recommend this dryer!
There aren't too many of the soft bonnet hairdryers available, so this is the one that I've had the most success with. I just wish it were easier to get replacement bonnets. I recently ordered 3 for the dryer that I already had, but the bonnets have been on &#34;back order&#34; for months, so I had to buy a whole new dryer.
I love this hair dryer.  There are more settings on this dryer than I have ever had.  It seems to dry my hair quicker
So far, this is the first time I've purchased the real Pro with affordable price...it dry fast with impressive speed....Love it
Its brand new, just as expected. Works perfectly! It fits all of the descriptions of when I purchased this product!
This dryer is powerful enough it just produces luke warm air.  It was very convenient to install as clippped right on to the existing sunbeam plate bracket.
I loved my new hair dryer.  it way 2cute!!. it looks like a cute toy but works pretty good . I think it is pretty powerful. it dries up my hair extensions good :)
Really love this hair dryer.  It is super lightweight and sleek.  Dries hair quickly and easily.  The price was on target and the shipping was ultra fast -- very pleased with the seller as well. Highly recommend product and seller! Kudos to both :)
I didn't need a new hair dryer but saw this John Frieda dryer in the store and I had to purchase! I gave it a try and was not happy. In my opinion there was not enough air coming out, and it sounds funny. I will return tomorrow.
I bought one of these in 2001 for a 3 week trip to Europe.  It's still going strong.  So, I purchased this for a young friend, just graduating from high school and headed to Spain for some future studies. Hopefully, she will have as good luck with her's as I have had!
It is convenient and one doesn't have to bend a stretch to locate it.  It hangs on the wall and the night light is great!
The styling of blow-dryer is great; the functions are not! The cool down button feature was pressed once for use, but got stuck inside of unit wobbling around, but would not release back so the warm mode. The 240 V option only worked on the low feature. Also, I found the brush attachment flimsy, not firm and would eventually wear out quickly. SUB-STAND FEATURES ruined a great looking unit! Quality would be the remedy! This could have been a winner...sad;(
This is the only hairdryer I've ever seen that has a cool blower setting as well as a cool shot button. I like the cool blower for finishing when the day is hot. I keep pressing the cool shot button accidentally, however, because it's so darn convenient. The cool shot button is exactly where my thumb naturally rests and I have to keep that in mind. The cord is shorter than I'd like, and a good bit shorter than my last dryer. The sliding controls aren't wonderful. The friction ridges are quite flat and the two slides mesh so well and are so narrow that my thumb can't tell them apart. I have to press those flat ridges so hard that it hurts my thumb, so I use my &#34;off&#34; hand to slide the controls. There's some kind of thin, plastic-like finish that's slowly peeling off, but that doesn't bother me at all.<br /><br />My last dryer was a Black & Decker. It was very small and compact and did the job for many years, possibly as much as 20 years. I do still wish I could have replaced it with the same thing.<br /><br />All this sounds like complaining, I know, but they're trivial complaints (except the cord length). I've never had a diffuser attachment before but I found it worth learning to use. I used to dry and style my short, curly hair in about a minute on the hot setting, but now the diffuser and the warm setting do it just as fast and better. The Conair hot setting is pretty hot, so if you need that you'll be happy. Best of all is that, even in the winter, my hair never gets flyaway with static electricity.<br /><br />I've had this Conair less than a year, so I can't comment on its durability.<br /><br />BTW, I bought this upon the recommendation of Consumer Reports. They called it a good value and I certainly agree.<br /><br />I've had it almost 4 years now and it's still trouble-free.
Long and heavy duty cord, powerful, great attachments, enough settings and the buttons are a little recessed so you can't mistakenly hit them while you're drying.  Fees sturdy but not too heavy.  Good product for the buck.
Never heard of this brand before, but found it in a boutique hotel and was very pleased with so I ordered it from Amazon.  Really reduces drying time which results in smoother hair.  Highly recommend.
Great price. It's a good brand, I did my research and its easy to control because of the different heatsettings .i recommend . Others brands are expensive when you could just get this product for less.
The greatest thing this dryer has is the retractable cord - and, of course the varied choices for temperature and blowing power!
Compact size. Powerful dryer. Light weight. Super cute hello kitty and pink. Dries my hair quickly. I highly recommend this product.
It replaced my old ConAir ionShine with retracting cord. I was able to buy those (the old ones) at the big W (you know where) for a reasonable price, but they would die about every 6 to 12 months. When the last one died, they didn't have any on the shelf (go figure). So I tried to find a replacement with this one.<br /><br />It's a shiny red color, but since it spends most of it's life in the cabinet under my sink, I don't think that's a big selling point. I like that this one has a retracting cord, and the fact that it doesn't fold in half like my old ones hasn't been a problem, so far. In fact, it's probably an engineering upgrade. I imagine the folding types break more easily.<br /><br />When I first started using it, it seemed to take a bit longer than average to dry my hair, but after a few uses, it seems to be &#34;broken in&#34; now. I like that it has cold, warm or hot options and low or high speeds. So, all in all, it does the job for a reasonable price and offers the retractable cord (which is a must for those of us who a bit OCD). Only gave it 4 stars because, well, it's not made of gold (which would probably melt from the heat anyway).
The socket blow up and got alot of sparkles make me so scary throw it away and didnt use it again ever
I originally came onto Amazon to search for  a dryer that I had found in a store that was out of stock.  Once logging on, I decided to peruse the selection of hair dryers in the same price range.  This dryer had the largest number of reviews and the highest rating.  I was replacing an old dryer and was looking for something that would dry my hair quickly and leave it looking smooth.<br /><br />Other reviewers commented on how great the Onei dryer was, citing it's speed in drying, it's ionic component that left hair smooth, and several even mentioned how quiet the dryer was.  The dryer arrived faster than anticipated and I was in love the first time I used it!!  It did dry my hair quickly (the same or faster than other dryers), my hair doesn't require a pass through with a flat iron on most days as it usually did, and it's actually REALLY quiet (like, abnormally so).  While I don't have to worry about waking anyone up, it's quiet enough not to drown out the phone ringing or my music playing while I get ready.<br /><br />The attachments are great...as is the long cord.  I really love this product and hope it lasts as long as other reviewers said it did!
I got this hairdryer because it was cheaper but still had great reviews. I would agree with some of the reviews in that there is not a very good medium heat, its either too hot or cool, but I still think it works great. I love it!
This is a truly fast dryer. It met or exceed my expectations. I have had it for about 6 months and love it.
This replaced a Conair Wallmount Dryer without the LED Night Light.<br />Found the Andis model to be compact especially with the unique cord hanger.<br />Does not seem as powerful however.<br />Bright night light a real plus!
